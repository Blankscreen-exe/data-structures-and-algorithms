# Data Structures And Algorithms

In this repository, I have stored all the data structes and algorithms I have practiced on.

### How to use this repo?
- All the code files here are categorized w.r.t Implementation of a Data Structure or an Algorithm
- In the root directory you will find 2 folders named **Data Structures** and the other named **Algorithms**
- Inside each of these directories is a collection of folder named according to each data structure or algo.
- Inside each of the above mentioned folders(point 3) there are different versions of code for *each Language*.
- Each source file contains a function or an object which is publicly callable. So you can use them just by downloading and importing to your **main.app** file.
- Each **main.app** also contains use cases.

### Acknowledgement
I thank the following contributors for making such a vast variety of learning resources freely available. Sincerely, without you guys, we would not have been able to learn a new tech or land a job anywhere.
